# Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains my solutions to all problems from an "Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures" course on Aizu Online Judge, completed in 2023.

**Language used: C**

## Note
This was originally for personal learning, so explanations and comments may be limited.

## Addition
Some problems were also solved in C#.
These solutions are available in the [C#_version](https://github.com/m5281021/Algorithm-and-Data-Structure-1-by-C-Sharp.git) directory.

Note: As with the C version, comments and explanations may be limited since this was originally for personal learning.
